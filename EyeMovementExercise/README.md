# EyeMovement 

    Name: Eye Movement Exercise  

    Description: This web page is an example of how to use JavaScript to set web page styles.
It's a good way to bind a code to user actions.  
Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events.

onmousemove usage in the JavaScript code.
We will use "mousemove" in our the 
code to triggered a response when the mouse moves over an element.

In our case, when the mouse moves near or around the eye the 
"eyeball" will move along with the mouse.

To be more specific, I was tasked to add the "eye" element that follows 
the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.
