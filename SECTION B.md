Learning Outcome Addressed
 3. Discuss CSS style guide and examples of programmatic styling


Why Use A Style Guide?
As you’ll recall a style guide defines the standards for developing code across team members. Style guides are important because a consistent way of writing code helps team members read and write the code efficiently.

Just as you started to use a JavaScript style guide in Week 4, you should follow this CSS style guide Download CSS style guidewhen writing CSS throughout the rest of the course. While your code will still run if it is formatted incorrectly, following the style guide gives you the opportunity to practice adhering to a standard, as will be expected of you on a development team. 

Instructions:

Review the style guide linked above and respond to the following questions:

What differences do you see between the standards outlined in the JavaScript style guide and the conventions outlined for CSS?
Reflecting on the CSS you have written so far, are there any standards that you know you haven’t been following?
It may be difficult to incorporate all of these standards at once. What is one standard you can focus on this week?

Q & A Discussion With Learning Facilitators
Do you have specific questions about a coding assignment? Did you encounter a bug that you are struggling to troubleshoot? This forum is the space to ask questions related to this module’s assignments and video content. It will be moderated by your Learning Facilitator.

Learning how to accurately describe problems that you encounter is a crucial skill for any software developer. If you can provide accurate information about the issue you’re facing, you will be more likely to receive meaningful answers to your questions.

Submission Instructions:

Follow these best practices when posting about a challenge to this discussion forum: 

Describe what you expect to happen.
Describe what is happening instead.
Provide detailed steps on how to reproduce what you have already done. 
Attach screenshots or code snippets of all relevant files.
As an example:

I am trying to display a picture of myself for my GitHub portfolio website. My picture should appear below my name when I open the website. 
Instead of seeing my picture, I see a broken image. 
To reproduce my work, I created an index.html with an <h1> tag containing my name and an <img> tag with my photo’s file name. I uploaded these files to GitHub.
